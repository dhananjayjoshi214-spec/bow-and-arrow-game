This is a small console game I worked on in C. The bow is fixed on the left, and the target moves up and down on the right. I press space to shoot an arrow. If the arrow reaches the same row as the target, itâ€™s a hit. The program uses a game loop to keep updating positions and redrawing the screen. I used global variables to store the game state, _kbhit() for instant key detection, and Sleep() to control the game speed
